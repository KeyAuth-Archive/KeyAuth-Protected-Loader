# KeyAuth Protected Loader

A basic protection for your KeyAuth loader, nothing too advanced. All credits are within the code in their respective files.
Thank you to Alexander Rapaso for the AntiVM. I may consider adding more things to this in the future but these are the only random features I can think of at the moment.

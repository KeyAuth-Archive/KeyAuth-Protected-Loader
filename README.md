# KeyAuth Protected Loader

A basic protection for your KeyAuth loader, nothing too advanced. All credits are within the code in their respective files.
Thank you to Alexander Rapaso for the AntiVM. I may consider adding more things to this in the future but these are the only random features I can think of at the moment.

## Installation


```bash
 1. Download Project
 2. Add your KeyAuth Information to variables.h
 3. Once you've done that scroll down in the main and configure
 the downlaod file if you want. 
 4. Build on Release x64
```
